- Source signals  
This folder contains the clean source signals.
- Mixture_03m(-60)_1m(60)_200ms  
This folder contains the 100 mixtures tested in the 1st simulation. 
The filename stands for: 'name of Source 1'-'name of Source 2'-'input SIR of Channel 1'-'input SIR of Channel 2'.   
Here Source 1 is SOI.
- Multichannel mixture  
Those folders are numbered from 1 to 20, each folder contains the mixed signals generated by different sources and their source number ranges from 2 to 6.   
Those signals are tested in the 2nd simulation.  
The filename stands for: 'number of interferences (number of channels)'-'name of Source 1'-'name of Source 2'-...-'input SIR of SOI'.  
Here Source 1 is SOI.
