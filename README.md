- Source signals  
This folder contains the clean source signals.
- mixture_03m(-60)_1m(60)_200ms  
This folder contains the 100 mixtures tested in the 1st simulation. 
The filename stands for: 'name of Source 1'-'name of Source 2'-'input SIR of Channel 1'-'input SIR of Channel 2'.   
Here Source 1 is SOI.
- Multi-channel mixture  
This folder contains 20 subfolders, the mixed signals in each subfolder are generated by different sources.   
Those signals are tested in the 2nd simulation.  
The filename stands for: 'number of interferences (number of channels)'-'name of Source 1'-'name of Source 2'-...-'input SIR of SOI'.  
Here Source 1 is SOI.
